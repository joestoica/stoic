# Stoic

This is a package for my personal use. It contains functions that I've written and found useful in my analysis, as well as ggplot themes, color palettes, and RMarkdown themes. 

[Here is the article I used as my primary reference.](https://towardsdatascience.com/build-a-corporate-r-package-for-pleasure-and-profit-78b73ce4ff4b) 

The inst folders contains directories used to create rmarkdown templates.

R scripts are found in the R folder.
