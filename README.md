Overview
--------

This is a package for my personal use. It contains functions that I've written and found useful in my analysis, as well as color palettes and ggplot and RMarkdown themes. It will be updated whenever I find something useful to add to it.

[Here is the article I used as my primary reference.](https://towardsdatascience.com/build-a-corporate-r-package-for-pleasure-and-profit-78b73ce4ff4b)

The inst folders contains directories used to create rmarkdown templates.

R scripts are found in the R folder.
